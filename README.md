# Concert Ticket bookin
This site can be used to provide the registration for any grand or big event, here for instance I have used an upcoming musical concert that is to be held  in some days at Mangauru.  our app provides basic as well as advanced functionalities. Here the most basic functionality, that is to successfully registered for the event, for this user has to fill a given form consisting of some basic required fields (name, contact -no, email, image of their id proof, type of reg.,no. of tickets for the event), Here we are using email as a unique auth, which means one email can be registered only once. The user can preview their registration and  finally when they successfully registered we will generate a registration no. for them.

Now for the admin side, admin can log-in to its portal by provide its credentials, once logged in, admin can access everything like seeing the no. of registration in each category of registration like self, corporate, group etc. and also he access details of any registration by just searching the registration number generated in userâ€™s registration . He can see every registration that has done for the event.   

## Technology and features
Here for the user's interface we have used html,css,js, along with jquery and bootstraph 4, for developing server side we have used node.js with express framework and mongoDB as our database.
